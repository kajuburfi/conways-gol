<center><h1>Certain Patterns you can begin with..</h1></center>


## Usage:
After creating an executable file, say `cgol`, use the following command to use any one of the pre-existing patterns in your terminal
```sh
./cgol -f patterns/<pattern_name>
```

## List of patterns and basic description of what they do:-

- `big_glider` - Loads a bigger version of the famous glider.
- `blinker_ship` - Loads a blinker ship which generates blinkers as it moves and also eats them up.
- `boat_maker` - Loads a boat generator.
- `brain` - Loads a brain-like structure which glides on the screen.
